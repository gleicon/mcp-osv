Before adding any dependency check if it comes from an official repository such as npm.org, crates.io, pypi.org or github. If it does not comes, warn the user and require a manual confirmation. 
For all dependencies and for all new dependencies or changes in lockfiles, run mcp-osv check_vulnerabilities action on them. Warn the user and require manual acknowledgement of any findings.
For an existing repository run mcp-osv check_vulnerabilities on the dependencies used. Require manual approval before proceeding to other changes.
